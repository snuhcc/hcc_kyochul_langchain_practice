Alex Sobel highlighted the need for continuing payments for sensitive maintenance, emphasizing the importance of investing in skills and skills-based activities to meet existing targets. He noted that the UK is one of the most severely nature-depleted countries worldwide and that the Natural History Museum's biodiversity intactness index has revealed that the world has crashed through the safe limit for humanity for biodiversity loss. The UK's 53% score is in the bottom 10% of all countries, and the Conservatives' Environment Act 2021 target on species abundance is to "halt the decline" by 2030, which is not good enough. The Labour party aims to be "nature positive" and focus on improving rewilding, reforesting, and biodiversity, with all natural landscapes being part of that. The party will support farmers to be part of this transition and ensure that they are not left behind.

<Section 2>
Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a lifelong farmer, discussed the challenges faced by farmers due to the fluctuating global economy, energy prices, and inflation. He noted that farm input cost inflation in 2023 stood at 42%, and wholesale energy prices were 1.5 times higher compared to 2019. The UK's food sufficiency rate has decreased from 78% in 1984 to 60% in 2021, and the nation is only 18% self-sufficient in fruit, 55% in vegetables, and 71% in potatoes. He emphasized the need to produce policies that increase self-sufficiency rates in these commodities. The Government's new annual UK-wide food security index and the Farm to Fork summit are welcome initiatives, but more needs to be done to support farmers and ensure a healthy and sustainable food supply.

Mr Alistair Carmichael discussed the importance of agriculture in Scotland, which is a £3.3 billion industry employing 67,000 workers. He noted that the sector is critical to the economy of the northern isles, with Orkney being prime suckler beef pasture and Shetland ideal for sheep production. The lack of certainty for farmers is a major concern, and the Scottish Government's plans to take 20% of land out for environmental and tree planting purposes are unrealistic and will lead to job losses and livelihoods being affected. A multi-annual ringfenced budget is needed to support Scottish farming, and the Treasury must come forward with a framework based on this agreement.

The Prime Minister's statement that farmers do not do it for the money is not good enough, and the Government must take immediate action to counteract the freefall they have created. A Labour Government would pursue a new veterinary agreement with the EU, back the NFU's Buy British campaign, and simplify the ELM schemes.

<Section 9>
George Freeman discussed the need for a long-term, secure policy framework for the commercial sector, as well as an environmental framework for skills and innovation.

He emphasized the need to give farmers a framework that works for them as small businesses and to nurture the skills of tomorrow.

<Section 10>
Sarah Dyke discussed the challenges faced by farmers, including the lack of funding, workforce planning, and the need to renegotiate recent trade deals. She noted that the Liberal Democrats have a real plan to support farmers and rural communities, starting with a £1 billion boost to the farming budget.

<Section 11>

DEBATE_MISTRAL_7B_v0_3 69 6 7
<Section 1>
The Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities introduces a bill to prevent public bodies from boycotting foreign countries, with a focus on Israel. The bill is in response to the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement, which seeks to delegitimize Israel and harm its economy. The bill is intended to protect minority communities, particularly the Jewish community, from campaigns that harm community cohesion and fuel antisemitism. The bill has been met with criticism from some Members of Parliament, who argue that it infringes on freedom of speech and expression, and that it is too broad in its scope.

<Section 2>

<Section 3>
Lisa Nandy moves a reasoned amendment to the bill, which would decline to give it a Second Reading. She argues that the bill risks undermining support for groups facing persecution, is incompatible with international law, undermines the UK's long-standing cross-party position on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, singles out Israel, places unprecedented restrictions on the ability of public bodies to express a view on policy, has potential widespread and negative impacts on local government pension funds, limits freedom of speech, and is likely to be subject to repeated and extended legal challenge.

<Section 5>
Chris Stephens argues that the bill is a "dog's breakfast" and a "desperate attempt by the UK Government to salvage something from the wreckage they have created across the fields of international trade, diplomatic relations, and human rights." He criticizes the bill for stifling local democracy, undermining the UK's position on Israeli settlements, and ignoring environmental concerns. He also argues that the bill will have a chilling effect on free speech and will increase antisemitism.

<Section 6>
Dame Margaret Hodge argues that the bill is flawed, poorly drafted, and will have damaging consequences both in the UK and abroad. She criticizes the bill for singling out Israel, increasing antisemitism, cancelling free speech, centralizing power, and supporting the actions of the present Israeli Government. She also argues that the bill will make peace in the region more difficult and will not protect or advance the interests of the Jewish community.

<Section 7>
Sir Simon Clarke agrees with many comments from across the House on the nature of the defective bill. He expresses concern about the safety of the Jewish community, the practical impact of the bill on many organizations across the country, the free-speech challenge posed by clause 4(2), the potential for legal challenges, and the potential for the bill to be seen as partial and privileging one country over others. He also argues that the bill will send a chill through debate about a series of conflicts across the world, and will have a particularly negative impact on academic freedom.
